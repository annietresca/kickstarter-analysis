# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	This project examines the outcomes for play kickstarter funding based on launch date as well as based on goals. 

### Purpose

	 The purpose of this analysis is to provide a succinct relay of historical data in order to help inform future kickstarting campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

	The following images relay the data gathered in this analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	We first analyzed theater related kickstarter outcomes based on launch date. As a result of this analysis, it became clear that the most successful theater campaigns are launched during May and June. Alternatively, campaigns launched in November and December had the worst outcomes. Cancelled campaigns stayed fairly consistent throughout the year with January and March as exceptions. In January, more theater kickstarter campaigns were cancelled than in any other month while in October none were cancelled. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	We then analyzed outcomes based on goals initially laid out for the kickstarter campaign. Through the analysis, it became clear that kickstarters with a goal less than $5,000 had a higher percentage of success as well as kickstarters with goals between $35,000 - $44,999. It also became clear that kickstarters with goals too high had high percentages of failure, with campaigns greater than $45,000 almost always failing. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	When creating this analysis, it was challenging to ensure the y-axis was displaying the correct percentage in the outcomes based on goals analysis. It became clear that this could be easily fixed if columns B - E were hidden during the creation of the line graph. Upon saving the line graph, the columns could be unhidden to reveal the full data set and the newly saved image could be added into the sheet.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	
	In short, this data conveys that future theater related kickstarters should be launched mid year in order to achieve the best chance at success. Kickstarter campaigns launched in May/June had the highest rate of success while campaigns launched in Nov/Dec had the lowest rate of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Based on the findings from our outcomes based on goals analysis, setting a goal that is < $5,000 will position you to be more successful in fundraising.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	
	It is worth noting that when analyzing the data based on goals, there were no instances of cancellations - a short coming worth knowing if one would want to have a more micro view of what may impact future campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	In the future, it would be recommended to examine the outcomes based on country as well as looking at outcomes based on year. If one were to analyze the outcomes based on country, it could help future kickstarters decide what country they would be most successful to launch in.  If one were to analyze trends across years, it could potentially reveal if there is a trend indicating plays are on an upward or downward trajectory. Another potential analysis could be  to analyze outcomes based on the average donation pledged as it could provide good insight into what future campaigns could market their ideal donation as.
